I focused on contemporary autistic-led activism, which sees autism as a difference that needs to be accommodated rather than a problem that needs to be solved. I ended the slideshow by answering students' questions and comments about the information; I could always tell that the presentation was well received. I later adapted this presentation for a staff meeting at Rockland Jewish Family Service. This agency frequently assists neurodiverse clients and the staff thanked my greatly for the slideshow. Finally, I presented on this topic to NYU Master of Social Work students, emphasizing the implications of the subject matter for social work.
